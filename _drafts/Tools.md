title: Tools
---

My dad ran an HVAC business for decades and he used to talk about taking your
tools with you when you moved to another job site.  I didn't really think
much of that because it seemed logical.  You bought yourself a set of hammers,
chisels, power tools, etc and they were yours.  That idea popped back into
my head recently when a company I was working for went bankrupt suddenly.  
They were a startup so I suppose I should've expected that but that's a 
different story.  The really devistating thing to me wasn't that I lost
my job suddenly.  That was stressful but I knew I'd find something.  
The worst part about it was the tools I had built there which I was 
very proud of were now suddenly gone.  I had spent 6 months creating
a Ceph management service and it was damn good.  That software is now
rotting on some oracle servers somewhere.  I asked around and it would
be nearly impossible to get oracle's lawyers to agree to release this
software back out into the world.  

My dad's scenario popped back into my head.  Imagine at every job site 
a contractor had to forge himself a hammer before he could 
put a nail into anything.  
It would be insane and yet today that's normal in software land.  I'm tired of
creating the same stuff over and over and over again.  So going forward
my new policy is open source first.  Jobs these days are not stable and
having to start over is extremely frustrating.  The other thing that 
was striking about the bankruptcy was that a coworker of mine had been
stragtegically open sourcing pieces of his work as he went along.  When
everything hit the fan he walked away and picked up right where he left
off.  I was stunned.  As engineers we're doing ourselves a disservice 
by not writing our software in the open.  How many amazing tools have
I built that are rotting somewhere?  At least if they were rotting on 
github someone could come along and pick up if they really wanted to 
and continue the work.
